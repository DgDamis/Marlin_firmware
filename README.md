This version is a merge of "thr33thirteen", "prahjister" and "coptertec" versions. <br>
It was mixed so I would have my favourite features available even in the version that supports SKR mini E3 1.2 board. <br>

# SV01-skr-e3-mini-1.2
Firmware for Sovol SV01 with the <b>BigTreeTech SKR E3 Mini v1.2</b> with the LCD12864 (ender) screen and BL touch. Enables Linear Advance. 
This is a work in progress. It will produce usable prints but my not be 100% error free.

Place the firmware.bin file on the micro sd card, insert it into the skr board and boot. It should flash the firmware.

You may need to alter your BL touch to make it work with this board. I will publish pictures of my wiring once the firmware is ready.
